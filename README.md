## Hi there! / Hola! / Salut! 👋

My name is Manuel Agustín Miglioranza. I'm a Full Stack Web Developer currently based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

### About me:

I love everything that involves programming and technology. I am passionate about learning new skills and technologies that can impact positively in peoples lives and businesses, and help me become a better developer & programmer. I am very curious about everything: you'll always find me reading, studying or learning something new, whichever the field or topic!

I am currently looking for opportunities to challenge and improve my programming knowledge and expertise, and to contribute in small and big projects. I am particularly interested in front-end & back-end technologies, as well as testing.

### My current tech stack:

JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, React.js, Redux.js, React-Native, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, Mongoose, Git, Heroku, Vercel, Docker, HTML, CSS.

### My to-do / doing list:
